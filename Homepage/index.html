                    <b>A highscore strategy/metroidvania <span class="cyan">spaceshooter</span></b> based on the popular arcade game "<span class="lightgrey">Asteroids</span>". Made with the help of Shaun Spaldings tutorials.
                    <br><br>The twist is that your <span class="cyan">spaceship</span> switches between 3 <i>colors</i> randomly every time you collect a few points. Every time you shoot a few <span class="lightgrey">asteroids</span>, new ones will spawn. These <span class="lightgrey">asteroids</span> have their own <i>color</i> too and can only be destroyed if the <span class="cyan">spaceship</span> matches the <i>color</i> of the <span class="lightgrey">asteroid</span>. And because you need points to switch the <i>color</i> of the <span class="cyan">spaceship</span>, you will get stuck with <span class="lightgrey">asteroids</span> near you that cannot be destroyed. Therefore there are 2 other type of <span class="lightgrey">asteroids</span>. One of them is a <span class="grey">grey</span> smaller and slower <span class="lightgrey">asteroid</span> that is worth less points, but can be shot by any <i>color</i> <span class="cyan">spaceship</span>. When you destroy a normal <span class="lightgrey">asteroid</span>, 2 <span class="grey">grey</span> ones will spawn and that you can just keep flying around for when you need the points to switch <i>color</i>. This is where to strategy part comes in to the game. The other special <span class="lightgrey">asteroid</span> is a normal sized <span class="rainbow">rainbow asteroid</span> that can also be shot by any <i>color</i>. 
                    <br><br>You have 3 lives in the game and get a <span class="black">bomb</span> at a certain amount of points that destroys all <span class="lightgrey">asteroids</span> on the screen when you use it, in case it becomes a bit tight up there.

                    <br><br>You play as a skateboarding <span class="orange">pineapple</span> with boosters on the back, because the <span class="orange">pineapple</span> doesn’t have long enough legs (not because animations are hard). On the top and bottom are innocent <span class="red">fruits</span> that spit out <span class="lightgrey">bullets</span> that will kill you. The game has <i>3 normal levels</i> and a <span class="rainbow">special fourth level</span> that has all of them combined before you reach the <i>credits</i>. All <i>normal levels</i> have a different <span class="red">fruit</span> in them that vary in the amount of <span class="lightgrey">bullets</span> that are spit out at the same <b>time</b>, the <b>length</b> of the <span class="lightgrey">bullet</span> or the <b>direction</b> of the <span class="lightgrey">bullet</span>. The goal is to dodge the <span class="lightgrey">bullets</span> and reach the end of the level to get to the next level. After you pass all the 4 levels, you will be rewarded with a beautiful <i>end screen</i>.
                    <br><br>The hard part of the game is that you don’t have lots a time. On the left you can find an <b>angry</b> <span class="red">Mr. Strawberry</span>, <span class="darkred">Cherry</span> or <span class="yellow">Banana</span> that are pushing a <i>wall</i> that will push you into the <span class="lightgrey">bullets</span> if you’re not quick enough. If you do happen to hit a <span class="lightgrey">bullet</span> (which will happen a lot), you will have to start <b>all over</b> again, even If you die in one of the last levels.

                    <br><br>This is the first <span class="orange">game jam</span> where I wasn’t doing it <i>alone</i>. My and a friend of mine worked together to create this game. The programming and management was done by <b>me</b>, the art and animations were done by <b>him</b>. It was nice working together, but we were both a bit stressed because of the lack of <i>experience</i>. I had only a week of experience with the <span class="cyan">new engine</span> I decided to use and he normally doesn’t create a lot of art, so we were both really new to this and had trouble getting past the <i>bugs</i> and <i>mistakes</i>. In the end we were able to pull trough after a very long <span class="black">night</span> and submitted something we could be a tiny bit proud of, so it felt like a victory in my book.

                    I am very thoughtful and self-aware person that likes to be in his own head a lot and wants to see the logic behind eveything, 
                    but also loves working together with people that think the same way as me and have overlapping passions and interests.
                    I like to challenge myself and am very determined when it comes to projects I decide to spend a lot of time on.
                    I'm confident in my intelligence and knowledge, but am not afraid to ask things when I don't know them.

                <p>
                    In my daily life I like to hang out with my friends and fellow students online to play all kinds of games.
                    I also livestream on Twitch where I speedrun retro games like Super Mario 64 most of the time and try to entertain the people that are watching and chatting.
                    From time to time I also turn those streams into short funny highlights on Youtube.
